DataCamp SQL Projects Portfolio

About Me
Hi! Iâ€™m an aspiring Data Analyst, passionate about data and currently focusing on building strong skills in SQL.  

This repository contains SQL projects Iâ€™ve completed as part of my learning journey on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).  
The goal of this portfolio is to document my progress and demonstrate how Iâ€™m learning to analyze and work with real-world datasets.  

Through these projects, I am practicing:
- Writing SQL queries for data extraction and transformation  
- Joining, filtering, and aggregating datasets to find insights  
- Answering analytical questions using relational databases  
- Building a foundation for advanced analytics and reporting  


Projects

1. Analyze International Debt Statistics
- Description: Used SQL to explore international debt data collected by The World Bank. Answered key analytical questions such as the number of distinct countries in the dataset, which country holds the highest debt, and which has the lowest amount of repayments. The project demonstrates skills in querying, filtering, and aggregating real-world financial data.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
As I continue my learning journey, Iâ€™ll keep adding new **SQL projects** to this repository. My goal is to grow into a role as a **Data Analyst in a tech company**, where I can apply SQL to solve business problems and support data-driven decision-making.
